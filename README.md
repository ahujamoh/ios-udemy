# ios-udemy
I finished this cool course, (a bit old though) on ios and was amazed at how quickly I can get my hands on the code. I am uploaded this code to help anyone who gets stuck with ios 10.0(as I was).


To get it working

go to ostetso.com, sign up and get app id and app key to get it, and put it in AppDelegate.

For any confusions, feel free to contact me.
